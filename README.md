# 1. Ideas & Grouping

> **Suggested Timeframe:** 2 days
> 
> **Note:** Students are not expected to start coding during this phase

## Summary

By the end of this phase, each group should have;

- a project
- a list of requirements
- decided on a project management tool

## Structure

1. [Introduction to the final project](#1-introduction-to-the-final-project)
2. [Finding project ideas](#2-finding-project-ideas)
3. [Form balanced teams](#3-form-balanced-teams)
4. [Create feature list](#4-create-feature-list)
5. [Introduction to Agile Development](#5-introduction-to-agile-development)
6. [Introduce project management tools](#6-introduce-project-management-tools)
7. [Schedule Stand-ups](#7-schedule-stand-ups)

### 1. Introduction to the final project

Use the following talking points to introduce the technical aspects of what is expected from a project;

- **Timeline** for the final project
- **Requirements** like team size, team member contribution, usage of version control system
- What **expectations** students can have for _themselves_, their _teacher_ and their _peers_

### 2. Finding project ideas

- Bring the class together to generate ideas, without judgement; it is important to separate idea generation from idea feasibility

- Avoid having an idea owner, that pitches an idea and people join around them and their idea, ideas should be malleable

- New groups may form around ideas, instead of groups based on previous friendships

### 3. Form balanced teams

Teams should be balanced, so that each group will have a mix of skills (design / frontend / backend).

The team will share responsibilities but will define roles:

- **Project Manager** - Responsible for team communication and co-ordination. The Project Manager should organize any team meetings and should ensure the group stays on track.
- **Repository Maintainer** - Responsible for enforcing correct GIT processes, such as ensuring team members are not directly committing to the main / master branch, and that new features are added using the PR (pull request) system.
- **Lead Frontend Developer** - Responsible for co-ordinating the front-end tasks and for providing support to the other frontend developers. Ideally the lead frontend developer would be the most experienced frontend developer in the group.
- **Lead Backend Developer** - Responsible for co-ordinating the backend-end tasks and for providing support to the other backend developers. Ideally the lead backend developer would be the most experienced backend developer in the group.

### 4. Create feature list

- What problem are the students solving with this application
- What can the user do with it?
- Create MVP (minimum viable product) feature list project roadmap (what we want to achieve by the end of the 7 weeks if everything goes as planned)

### 5. Introduction to Agile Development

- [What is Agile Delopment?](./AGILE.md)
- [What is Scrum?](./SCRUM.md)
- [What is Kanban?](./KANBAN.md)
- [Teaching and Learning Scrum and Agile](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/teaching-learning-scrum-agile-values-puzzle-game-ignacio-paz/)
- [Agile Games](https://www.tastycupcakes.org/)
- [User Stories exercise](https://courses.cs.ut.ee/MTAT.03.244/2016_fall/uploads/Main/SPM2-Ex1.pdf)

### 6. Introduce project management tools

- [Trello](https://trello.com/)
- [Github Projects](https://github.com/features/issues)

### 7. Schedule Stand-ups

Communication within a team is vital. As part of the agile process, each team must agree on a daily meeting to discuss their daily tasks. Deeper discussions should be held in a separate meeting.

- Stand-ups are a daily occurrence
- The teacher should be present during the stand-up
- Stand-ups are meant to be short. Each team member should speak for **no more than 5 minutes**.
- Team members should talk about what their current tasks; they can also talk about what they did on the previous day (if relevant)
- Stand-ups are a good time to talk about any issues (blockers) that can prevent a task from moving forward, and if possible, enlist help from other team members
